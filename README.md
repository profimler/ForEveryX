# ForEveryX
This is an introduction to logic book which is a mashup of two OER reasoning works: For All X, the Lorain County Remix by Loftin and An Introduction to Reasoning by Woods. We use Woods for a discussion on real-world reasoning (informal logic) and Loftin as an introduction to formal logic.
